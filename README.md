To run a Python (.py) file, you need to have Python installed on your computer. Here are the steps to run a .py file on Windows, Mac, and Linux:

On Windows:

Open the Command Prompt by pressing the Windows key and typing "cmd" in the search box. Navigate to the directory where your .py file is located using the 'cd' command. For example: cd C:\Users\UserName\Documents\MyPythonFiles Type the command "python filename.py" and press Enter to run the Python file. For example: python my_script.py On Mac and Linux:

Open the Terminal application. Navigate to the directory where your .py file is located using the 'cd' command. For example: cd ~/Documents/MyPythonFiles Type the command "python filename.py" and press Enter to run the Python file. For example: python my_script.py Note: If you have multiple versions of Python installed on your computer, you may need to specify which version of Python to use. For example, "python3 filename.py" if you have both Python 2 and Python 3 installed.
